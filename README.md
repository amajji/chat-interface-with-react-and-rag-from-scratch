## :monocle_face: Overview


This project provides a real-time Chat Interface powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), with both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) components. It supports file uploads, document chunking, embedding generation, and querying documents using semantic search.

The system enables plugging any LLM for document retrieval and allows efficient search through a collection of documents. The project includes functionality for document processing and chunk management, stored in an SQLite database.

## üîß Features

The flow works as follows:

1 - File Upload: Allows users to upload documents easily to the backend.

2 - Document Chunking: Automatically splits documents into smaller, manageable chunks for more efficient processing and analysis.

3 - Embedding Generation: Uses transformer models to compute high-quality embeddings for each document chunk.

4 - Similarity Search: Enables querying of document chunks and returns the most relevant ones based on cosine similarity with the input query.

5 - Customizable File Processing: Users can toggle whether files should be considered for processing through the take_into_account flag.

6 - Database Integration: Uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy for storing file metadata, chunk data, and processing status, ensuring efficient data management and querying.

7 - RAG System: Developed from scratch, the RAG system allows for flexible integration with any LLM, providing advanced document retrieval and query answering capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  - Backend: FastAPI, Uvicorn (Python)
  - Frontend: React, Axios
  - ML Models: Prophet, Transformer Models (for embeddings and sentiment analysis)
  - Database: SQLite, SQLAlchemy




## üöÄ Getting Started 
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amajji/chat-interface-with-react-and-rag-from-scratch.git
cd chat-interface-with-react-and-rag-from-scratch
```

2. Install Dependencies
Backend: 
- Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

- Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Start the Application
In the root directory of the project, you can run both the frontend and backend together using concurrently.
```bash
npm start
```

This will:

  - Start the backend (FastAPI) server using uvicorn.
  - Start the frontend React development server.

The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000, and the frontend React app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

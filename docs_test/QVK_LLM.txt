    Vectorized Search:
        In the context of LLMs, vectorized search refers to the process of transforming text or queries into vectors (numerical representations) that the model can process more efficiently.
        These vectors capture the meaning of words or phrases in a high-dimensional space, allowing the model to compare, retrieve, and generate relevant responses more accurately.
    Knowledge Integration:
        QVK LLMs are designed to integrate external knowledge effectively by transforming knowledge into a form that the model can work with, such as vectors. This enables the model to quickly retrieve and use relevant information for answering queries or generating text.
        The model can query a knowledge base or database that has been vectorized, enabling efficient retrieval of contextual information based on the input query.
    Efficient Query-Answering:
        By vectorizing the queries and knowledge, QVK LLMs can provide faster and more accurate responses. The model can understand the context and retrieve relevant information with better performance than traditional keyword-based systems.
    Applications:
        Search Engines: QVK LLM can be used to improve search engines by making them better at interpreting user queries and retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of text.
        Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: By integrating vectorized knowledge, QVK LLMs can improve the accuracy of conversational AI systems by providing them with the most relevant and up-to-date information.
        Document Retrieval: Systems that need to pull documents based on a user's query can benefit from vectorized representations, allowing for more accurate and faster retrieval.
How QVK LLM Works:

    Input Processing: The user query or input is transformed into a vector that represents the meaning and intent behind the text.
    Knowledge Retrieval: The model queries a vectorized knowledge base or corpus, retrieving the most relevant pieces of information based on the vectorized query.
    Answer Generation: The model generates an output (text or response) by utilizing the relevant knowledge retrieved during the process.
